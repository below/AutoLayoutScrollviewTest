AutoLayoutScrollviewTest
========================

*Copyright notice at the end of this document*

After a hint from @jaredsinclair, I changed the whole design to **UICollectionView**. This works rather nicely, for the most part.

But, there are still:

Questions
---------

Everything works well in portrait mode, but when I switch to landscape, everything is gone â€¦ what gives?

I presume something is wrong with the AutoLayout Constraints of the cell or its imageView, will check that next.

The hint I get from the console is: 

	the behavior of the UICollectionViewFlowLayout is not defined because:
	the item height must be less that the height of the UICollectionView minus the section insets top and bottom values.
